- [ ] **Hands-on Lab:** [Activity 2](/labs/lab02.md) - Build workflows with dependencies and matrix builds

### Module 3: Environments, Secrets & Security _(10-15 min)_
Implement secure deployment workflows with environment protection and secret management.

- Example: [environments-secrets.yml](/.github/workflows/environments-secrets.yml) - Multi-environment deployments
- [ ] **Hands-on Lab:** [Activity 3](/labs/lab03.md) - Configure environments with approvals and secrets

### Module 4: Reusable Workflows _(10-15 min)_
Create modular, reusable workflows to reduce duplication and standardize processes.

- Example: [reusable-workflow-template.yml](/.github/workflows/reusable-workflow-template.yml) - Calling reusable workflows
- Example: [super-linter.yml](/.github/workflows/super-linter.yml) - Code quality automation
- [ ] **Hands-on Lab:** [Activity 4](/labs/lab04.md) - Build and consume reusable workflows

### Module 5: Custom Actions _(10-15 min)_
Develop custom actions using JavaScript, TypeScript, and Docker for specialized automation.

- Example: [github-script.yml](/.github/workflows/github-script.yml) - Inline GitHub API automation
- Example: [hello-world-composite.yml](/.github/workflows/hello-world-composite.yml) - Composite actions
- Example: [use-custom-actions.yml](/.github/workflows/use-custom-actions.yml) - Custom action usage
- Reference: [githubabcs/hello-world-composite-action](https://github.com/githubabcs/hello-world-composite-action)
- [ ] **Hands-on Lab:** [Activity 5](/labs/lab05.md) - Create and use custom actions

### Module 6: Self-hosted Runners & Scalability _(5-10 min)_
Deploy and manage self-hosted runners for specialized workloads and cost optimization.

- Example: [self-hosted-linux.yml](/.github/workflows/self-hosted-linux.yml) - Using self-hosted runners
- [ ] **Hands-on Lab:** [Activity 6](/labs/lab06.md) - Understand self-hosted runner patterns

### Module 7: CI/CD Best Practices _(15-20 min)_
Build production-ready CI/CD pipelines with caching, artifacts, testing, and deployment strategies.

- Example: [ci-workflow.yml](/.github/workflows/ci-workflow.yml) - Continuous Integration
- Example: [cd-workflow.yml](/.github/workflows/cd-workflow.yml) - Continuous Deployment
- [ ] **Hands-on Lab:** [Activity 7](/labs/lab07.md) - Implement complete CI/CD pipeline
